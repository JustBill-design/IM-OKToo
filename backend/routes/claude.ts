- App tutorials and FAQs.
- A directory of local Singaporean resources (healthcare, support groups, services).
- Summaries of common forum questions and answers (anonymized).
- information on government grants (MOH programmes): Explore the available grants listed below, along with their eligibility criteria and application details.
Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF)
The SMF helps seniors age in their communities, by providing subsidies for items seniors need to use. These includes items like bandages and adult diapers, and assistive devices like wheelchairs.
What are the benefits?
Subsidies for eligible seniors help to cover the cost of healthcare items and assistive devices, so seniors can continue to stay independent and in familiar surroundings as they get older.
Caregivers Training Grant (CTG)
The CTG is for caregivers of seniors or those with disabilities. Caregivers can use the grant to attend training, and learn how to care for their loved ones, while looking after their own well-being.
What are the benefits?
Annual subsidies are available for eligible caregivers, to offset the cost of attending caregiver training courses run by approved providers.
Home Caregiving Grant (HCG)
The HCG provides a cash payout each month to families who are caring for their loved ones with lasting moderate disabilities in the community.
What are the benefits?
The grant can be used to pay for caregiving expenses (e.g. cost of care services, or hiring of a migrant domestic worker), to make it easier for families to provide care at home.
Migrant Domestic Worker (MDW) Levy Concession for seniors and persons with disabilities
The MDW Levy Concession supports households who need to hire a MDW to care for seniors or persons with disabilities. Each household is eligible for up to two MDW levy concessions, caring for two loved ones at any one time.
